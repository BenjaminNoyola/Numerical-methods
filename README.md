# Numerical-methods

Author: Benjamín Salomón Noyola García.

These are codes for a course of numerical methods in python, based on numpy, mathplotlib and scipy.

These codes were tested with python 2.7 but I am updating to python 3.8

You can run every code with the following instructions:

    <python code_name.py>
    
You can use and modify these codes.
